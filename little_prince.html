    <span>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.</span>
    <span class="textline"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
    <span class="textbackground"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
    <span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind,
    and I said to myself:</span>
    <span class="textred">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù </span>
    <span> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:</span>
    <span class="textred">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--
        the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span>
    <span>And I felt him to be more fragile still.</span>
    <span class="textline"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
