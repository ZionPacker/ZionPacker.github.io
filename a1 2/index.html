    Biography
    </h1>
    <p>
        My name is Zion Packer, and I'm Tampa Florida, however I've lived
        most of my life in Atlanta Georgia. I have three siblings,
        two sisters and a brother, and also a dog named Suki. I recently
        studied abroad in Barcelona and plan to return once I graduate college. 
        
        I'm currently participating in a Co-Op, so I have been off campus 
        for two years, switching between work and remote school every other 
        semester. Due to the Co-Op my graduation has been pushed back to 2025 from 2024,
        and I am just now taking many of the major computer science courses.
        However, I do have a considerable amount of experience in Python and a
        decent understanding of many other languages such as C++, Java, or R.
